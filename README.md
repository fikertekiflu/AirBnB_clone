# Airbnb Clone Project

## Description

The Airbnb Clone Project is a Python-based application that simulates a simplified version of the Airbnb platform. It allows users to manage various aspects of their Airbnb-like listings, such as creating, updating, and deleting listings, as well as performing searches and bookings.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Airbnb Clone Project. Users can enter commands to perform various actions, such as managing listings, searching for listings, and making bookings.

### Getting Started

To start the command interpreter, clone the project repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and run the `console.py` file using Python (`python console.py` or `./console.py`).

### Usage

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands at the prompt (`(hbnb)`) to interact with the application. Here are some basic commands you can use:

- `create <class>`
- `show <class> <id>`
- `update <class> <id> <attribute> <value>`
- `destroy <class> <id>`
- `all <class>`
- `quit` or `EOF`

## Examples

Here are some examples of commands you can enter in the command interpreter:

- `create User`
- `show Place 1234`
- `update Review 5678 rating 5`
- `destroy Amenity 9876`
- `all City`
